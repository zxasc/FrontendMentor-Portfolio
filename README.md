## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I really enjoyed writing CSS for this challenge. I feel like I've vastly improved my skills compared to all website designs that I've coded before. So much so that I actually feel content with putting this one out into public. I know that this CSS is far from perfect, but the sense of progression is quite overwhelming when finishing a more complex design like this one. I will continue to improve.

### Continued development

I'll try to use more technologies in my next projects, specifically a CSS framework. I also want to add more functionality, not just copy a design.
